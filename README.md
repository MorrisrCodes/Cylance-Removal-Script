# Cylance Removal Script
This repository contains scripts designed to remove Cylance, a difficult to remove endpoint security software. I provide three different methods, as no single method proved universally effective.

## Purpose
This tool was developed during my cybersecurity internship to assist my sponsor in transitioning from Cylance to a new security software. They encountered significant challenges in uninstalling Cylance, which led to the creation of these scripts.

## Methods
**Method 1:** Deleting the registry  
**Method 2:** Stopping services, Deleting registry, Disabling deletion protection feature, Deleting drivers, Delete registry folder  
**Method 3:** Stopping services, Disabling deletion protection feature, Deleting restore point, Deleting drivers  

## Acknowledgements
Special thanks to ChatGPT for assisting in the development of these scripts.
